 * optional fields, enums, one class per tag. Screens should not be: they want
 * display-ready values and a handful of verbs. This interface is that shape,

 * it. Regenerate the client after a contract change and only the adapter can
 * break; swap in a fake gateway and every screen can be tested without a server.
